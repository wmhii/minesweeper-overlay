# Minesweeper Overlay

This was a weekend project with the goal of creating a screen overlay that would read the screen for Google's minesweeper game and mark safe and unsafe squares. I started this project to learn OpenCV and how to make an overlay using PyQt5.

## Requirements
You will need Python3 with PyQt5 and OpenCv which I installed via pip:

```sh
pip3 install PyQt5
pip3 install opencv-python
```

## Usage
Have minesweeper visible to the screen and run overlay.py:
```sh
python3 overlay.py
```
